# Personal Style Guide

My personal branding is based on technology, because I do computery things. It's trying to be techy and geeky without shoving it in your face. It should look professional but have room for some fun. It goes well with more formal and boring content (like my CV or personal website) and with my more sarcastic writing style on my blog.

The color palette and secondary font choice are a reference to classic green-on-black color scheme, but with a more modern perspective. It is further inspired by the design of tech websites like [Wired](https://www.wired.com/). The design is flat because I don't like gradients and uses solid icons because there are more of them and they're easier to scale.

**Mission:** Procrastinate. Also play around with technology, but in the end hopefully make something cool, interesting, or useful.

**Audience:** My own ego

**Descriptors I want people to think of me:**

- Smart
- Tech-savvy
- Funny
- Confident
- Creative (Bonus: standards for graphic design in academia are usually pretty low)
- Unafraid of trying something new and OK with failing at it

**Goals:**

- Be a contact point for science communication
- Be known as an advocate in the STEM community
- Make myself visible in the academic world
- Get a tenure track job
- Develop interdisciplinary collaborations

**Points I want people to get:**

- Failing doesn't make you a failure
- Not knowing something doesn't mean you're stupid. We're all learning and no one knows everything.
- You don't have to fit the stereotypes. 

## Logo

The logo is a circuit representation of my first initial, because I do computery things. It may be used prominently (i.e., as a feature) or as an icon down to _______ pixels. The latter is likely prefered when heavy use of graphics is not the norm (such as a CV or as a watermark). It may also be used as a Favicon.

Don't be so full of yourself as to use it more than once on each page.

It is available as a vector (SVG) or raster (PNG) image. Never use it as a JPG image, because compression sucks.

*Include files, including PNG at various sizes/colors and favicon*

| Green                    | Dark                     | Light                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| [SVG (default: 32x32)]() | [SVG (default: 32x32)]() | [SVG (default: 32x32)]() |
| [32x32]()                | [32x32]()                | [32x32]()                |
| [64x64]()                | [64x64]()                | [64x64]()                |
| [128x128]()              | [128x128]()              | [128x128]()              |
| [256x256]()              | [256x256]()              | [256x256]()              |

### Usage

**DO:** Put text below or to the left of it

**DO:** Leave breathing room

**DON'T:** Rotate it

**DON'T:** Stretch it. (Seriously, why does this even need to be said? But it appears in all these kind of guides.)

**DON'T:** Underlay it behind something

**DON'T:** Use with too low contrast over an image

**DON'T:** Add outlines. The whole thing is already lines.

**DON'T:** Use multiple colors in the logo

**DON'T:** Use it as a letter in a word. It's just going to confuse people.

## Colors

### Color Palette

Primary brand color. This should never be used as a background color. It may be used for text, icons, and buttons.

- Green: `#00B140` (Pantone 354 C)

### Core Color Palette

Accompanying neutral colors

- Darkest: `#121212`
- Dark: `#363636`
- Light: `#FAFAFA`
- White: `#FFFFFF`

### Accent Color Palette

If additional colors are needed.

- Orange: `#...`
- Blue: `#...`

### Print

In printed documents, backgrounds should be white and primary text black, for quality when printed on a black and white printer. Use of secondary colors should be limited.

### Web

Both dark-on-light and light-on-dark text are acceptable, but light-on-dark should be reserved for titles and short blocks of text.

Light on dark text should be `#FFFFFF` on `#121212`.

Dark on light text should be `#363636` on `#FFFFF`. A background of `#FAFAFA` may be used for differentiating sections.

## Typography

The main font to be used for both title and body text is [**Montserrat**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat). It's clean, geometric, works across a variety of sizes, and has a broad range of weights available.

 *Weights?* Titles in Montserrat should never be in color (only in monochrome dark/light). All caps titles are acceptable but should only be used for short titles (e.g., page titles but not article titles). For visual hierarchy, all caps should never be used at a lower hierarchy than content that is not all caps. Don't use small caps.

Titles should use medium weight (500). Body text should be normal (400) with a base size of 16px and line height of 24px.

The secondary accent font is [**Share**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Share). It may be used for short text, such as subtitles and menu items. Its more upright design contrasts well with the shorter, longer look of Montserrat.

Share should not be used as a primary title font or for body text. It is the font of choice for menu items, dates, and authors. This may be used in any color in the above palettes. It's the "fun" font. It may be used in all caps for emphasis. Use it sparsely.

*Include specimen text for both fonts*

## Icons

Icons should come from the [Material design icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/). Any additional icons or illustrations should be solid, not outline style or with prominent strokes.

## Photos

### Personal Photo

In the event that I need a photo of myself, there are two options: formal and informal, available below in a variety of sizes with different cropping.

*Include both photos at various sizes and cropped/uncropped and square/rectangle*

| Casual                   | Formal                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| [Original (1500x1500)]() | [Original (1500x1500)]() |
| [768x768]()              | [768x768]()              |
| [512x512]()              | [512x512]()              |
| [256x256]()              | [256x256]()              |
| [128x128]()              | [128x128]()              |

### Other Photos

Avoid stock photos that look like stock photos. (Ha.) If illustrations are used, they should be flat -- none of this 2000s business clipart.

Multiple images in a row or gallery format should have space between them.

## Voice

I don't want to sound too serious or inaccessible. I want to be open, confident, and somewhat self-deprecating. I don't want to be an academic stuck in the ivory tower. I want to be engaged outside my bubble, speaking up for those outside my bubble and sharing from inside the bubble. At the same time, I don't want to alienate myself from future employers by coming across as immature, inappropriate, or uninformed.

Phrasing should be focused on action and verbs. For example, "Julia Makes Things" and "Julia Blogs," or blog sections "Making," "Sharing," and "Learning". Bonus points for articles with puns, alliteration, and sci-fi references in the titles. For general audience writing, try to eliminate jargon. Humorous metaphors and similes are often useful, but don't neglect content for the sake of style and swagger.

Some purposes require a more formal tone, primarily those involving academic standing and jobs. That's where this branding can take a more demure tone, leaving out the extra colors and icons and focusing on what I 

## Design

### Graphical Elements

Graphical design should be built around the following defining features:

- Flat design
- Geometric with sharp corners. Never use rounded corners.
- Circuits and other homages to technology
- Minimal use of bold lines (like logo and title outline)
- No excessive animation (which should be easy because I don't know how)

### Web

The recommended JavaScript framework is Vue, and recommended CSS Framework is Bulma. (These are combinable using Buefy, but I haven't used it yet.)

Given the use of Vue and Bulma, I make no guarantees about functionality with Internet Explorer or old browsers in general. (Sorry not sorry.)

## Brand Elements

These are the things I need to make to fit this style

- Personal website
- Blog
- CV/Resume (web and print)
- Cover letter (later)
- Business card (maybe)
