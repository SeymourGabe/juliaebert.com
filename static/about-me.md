## Who I Am

I am a PhD candidate in computer science at Harvard University. I am a member of the Self-organizing Systems Research group, where I study bio-inspired collective robotics with Prof. Radhika Nagpal. I am also a Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow (DOE CSGF)

Other highlights:

- Summer practicum in the space science group at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
- MRes in bioengineering (with distinction) from Imperial College London, as a Marshall Scholar
- Research co-op at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems
- BS in behavioral neuroscience from Northeastern University, where I earned a Goldwater Scholarship, DAAD undergraduate scholarship, and graduated with honors

## What I Do

### For Research

I am interested in biology, learning, robotics, and the interface between them, such as bio-inspired robotics, cooperative robot control, and artificial intelligence. During my PhD, my goal is to apply concepts from neuroscience and biological learning to improve the collective behavior of robots.

In the first years of my PhD, I developed an algorithm for a swarm of simple Kilobot robots to make decisions about multiple features of their environment, and I designed and built a set of larva-inspired robots that climb over each to move faster as a group. Now, I am developing methods to make it easier to create and understand complex swarm behavior -- imagine map reduce for robots.

I also care about science communication and outreach. I've spoken to an audience of hundreds of kids about bio-inspired robots, and this fall I will be giving a public talk on robotics through Harvard's Science in the News fall lecture series.

After my PhD, I plan to pursue a career in academic research.

### For Fun

I like to make silly things in my free time. Need a clickbait headline for your next science project? [I've got you covered.](http://sciencebait.juliaebert.com) Need some robots that climb over each other? [I made them in fun colors.](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/Harvard/people/julia-ebert/project/)

I am also on the [Harvard curling team](http://harvardcurling.com/), and I enjoy [baking cinnamon rolls](http://lazybaker.juliaebert.com/). (I made both those websites, too.)
