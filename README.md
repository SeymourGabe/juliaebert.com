## TO DO

- Make it properly responsive
- Squares aren't square on Firefox (dammit)
- Why are some subtitles not green? (eg home page squares)
- Adjust padding/font size on square tiles (esp. for responsive)
- CV as PDF (with header and footer)
- New pictures for research and programming (mockups)
- Make style guideline/branding page
- Redo images with proper sizes/compression for web (+ organize). Use compressor script
- Make logo a link to home and change color (figure out how to do that with embedded svg?)
- Create/add logo favicon
- Maybe add to footer?
- Animations (page transitions, anything else?)
- Check links
